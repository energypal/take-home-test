# Improvement Ideas

- Intermediate layout between small and large layouts
- Phone and postal code input placeholders to show expected format like [(...) ... ....]
- Dark mode
- ~~Implement email validation using react-hook-form to replace built-in validation for consistency~~ Built-in validation tooltip still shows up on submit
- More robust email validation? Regex cannot cover all possible email addresses and cannot determine if it's a real address
- Accessibility - attributes like aria-invalid, role in the HTML elements
