# Improvement Ideas

- Intermediate layout between small and large layouts

- Dark mode

- Phone no. input to enforce format: (123) 456 - 7890. Use RHF controlled component integration?

- Placeholder for phone number and postal code inputs?

- More robust email validation? Regex cannot cover all possible email addresses and cannot determine if it's a real address

- Accessibility: attributes like aria-invalid, role in HTML elements

- More responsive submission process such as loading indicator on button and disabled forms while request is being made

- More refined post-submission view, better messages

- Visual indication on fields themselves when input values are not valid
