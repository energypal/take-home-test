2. If you had time to add more features or functions, what would you consider doing?
    -Add on-screen error prompts insead of the popup default.
    -Customizing the response message after submit, so in the case of an server error there would be a message to call by phone for assitance. 
    -hide the form and show a thank you message confirming succesful submission.
    -clickable footer links
3. What libraries did you add if any? What are they used for?
    I added Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive layouts, the ui library that had been mentioned during our interview.
4. Are there any limitations to your implementation? (ex: does not work in IE)
    -Some browsers may not support React 18 but with Next.js React code is automatically transpiled into a compatible format for most browsers, so this limitation may not be significant. 
    -Older browsers may not support certain CSS features used by Tailwind CSS.
