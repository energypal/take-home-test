1. About how many hours did you contribute to this project?
I contributed approximately 6 hours to this project.

2. If you had time to add more features or functions, what would you consider doing?
- Allow for 9-digit zip codes. Also, maybe "Zip / postal code" label and reg ex that allows either format
- More responsive to different screen sizes. Right now, columns stack if the screen is narrow but the the form elements just get really small instead of flexing to stack on top of each other vertically
- Mask the phone number to make it easier for the user to validate visually (eg if the user types 5555555555, the display would show (555) 555-5555)
- Ensure that the page is WCAG compliant 

3. What libraries did you add if any? What are they used for?
- I added the react hook form library. It offers an efficient way to validate the field entries on the front end and dynamically display helpful error messages

4. Are there any limitations to your implementation? (ex: does not work in IE)
- Not optimized for mobile (fields don't collapse to a single row)
- Does not work in IE; does work in Firefox, Chrome, and Edge; unable to test in Safari or any other browsers
